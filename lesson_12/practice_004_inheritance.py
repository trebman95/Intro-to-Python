Create an Animal class. Its constructor should take the name of the animal
and store it as an instance attribute. This Animal class should also have
a greeting() instance method that takes a name as an argument and prints
out the message: "Hello <NAME>, I'm <NAME_OF_ANIMAL>"

Create Dog and Cat classes that inherit from Animal.
Create instances and make them greet you.
