# HOMEWORK: Dictionaries
# Read carefully until the end before you start solving the exercises.

# Basic Dictionary

# Create an empty dictionary and then add a few of your friends. Make the key their email (can be fake)
# and the value their name. When you're done, create the same dictionary as a pre-populated dictionary.


friends = {}
friends['joshua@email.com'] = 'Joshua'
friends['tom@email.com'] = 'Tom'

team = {
    'name': 'Patriots',
    'Division': 'AFC East',
    'Founded': 1970,
    'Location': 'New England'
}

print(friends)

# Nested Dictionary

# Create a nested dictionary for a list of 5 company employees.
# The key should be their employee id (an integer from 1-5 will do) and the value should be a dictionary with
# the name, department and salary of the employee.

employee_data = {
    1: {'name': 'Jamal',
        'department': 'HR',
        'salary': 45000

    2: {'name': 'Ashley',
        'department': 'Finance',
        'salary': 37000
        },
    3: {'name': 'Jenny',
        'department': 'Logistics',

        'salary': 55000
        }
}

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Accessing Values

# Use the previous nested dictionary and write some print statements that will answer the following:

# - Print a list of the employee IDs
# - Print the employee data for employee with the ID 3.
# - Loop over the employees and print all their names and salaries.

employee_data = {
    1: {'name': 'Jamal',

# Updating Values

# We have the following dictionary with employee salaries.

salaries = {
    'james' : 10000,
    'tom' : 15000,
    'ryan' : 16000,
    'julia' : 17000
}


# We need to increase everyone's salary by 1,000 and also add a new employee joseph with a salary of 18,000.
# Please come up with a way to do this using update()

#updated_salaries = {
#    'james' : 11000,
#    'tom' : 16000,
#    'ryan' : 17000,
#    'julia' : 18000,
#    'joseph': 18000
#}

salaries.update({name: salary + 1000 for name, salary in salaries.items()})

salaries.update({'joseph': 18000})

print(salaries)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deleting Values

# You remember those employees from Updating Values section? Well, Julia got fired, so we need to remove her
# name from the salaries dictionary. How would you do that?

salaries = {
    'james' : 10000,
    'tom' : 15000,
    'ryan' : 16000,
    'julia' : 17000

# Iterating over Dictionaries

# Given the list of movies below, please use view objects (keys(), values(), items() - where necessary) to answer
# the questions:

# - Is Black Panther in the list of movies?
# - Is there any movie for the year 2021?
# - Print a message for each element that shows the year, the title and the position in the dictionary (1-5).
#   Hint: use a counter.

films = {
   2016: "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens",
   2017: "Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi",
   2018: "Black Panther",
   2019: "Avengers: Endgame",
   2020: "Bad Boys for Life"
}

print("Black Panther" in films.values())
print(2021 in films)

# Exercise 1. Animal Shelter Volunteer

# You volunteer in a local animal shelter and you've stored information
# about different pets in a Python dictionary.
# Your task is to create a Python program that helps you:

# - Access the age of specific pets by their names.
# - Find out which pets are not yet adopted.
# - Identify the most common animal type in the shelter (e.g., dog, cat).

# Pre-code
# Initialize the shelter_pets dictionary
shelter_pets = {
   'Whiskers': {'Age': 2, 'Type': 'Cat', 'Adopted': False},
   'Fido': {'Age': 4, 'Type': 'Dog', 'Adopted': True},
   'Patch': {'Age': 1, 'Type': 'Dog', 'Adopted': False},
   'Snowball': {'Age': 3, 'Type': 'Rabbit', 'Adopted': True}
 }

# Access and print the age of Whiskers
print(shelter_pets['Whiskers']['Age'])  # Should output 2

# Access and print if Patch is a dog or cat
print(shelter_pets['Patch']['Type'])

# Access and print if Snowball is adopted or not
print(shelter_pets['Snowball']['Adopted'])

# Find out which pets are not yet adopted and print their names
for pet, info in shelter_pets.items():
    if not info['Adopted']:
       print(pet)

# Exercise 2. Best - selling books

# Create a Python program to manage a collection of best-selling books
# and their publication years. Your initial list of best-selling books may have inaccuracies
# or could be outdated. Therefore, you'll also practice updating single and multiple entries
# in your dictionary. Specifically, you will:

# - Update the title of a book for a specific year due to a naming convention change.
# - Update the titles for multiple books at once based on new sales data.
# - Delete a book and its year from the collection as it's no longer considered a best-seller.
# - Print the title of the book published in a specific year.

# Pre-code:
# Initialize a dictionary called best_selling_books to store your collection.

best_selling_books = {
   1997: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
   1984: "Neuromancer",
   2003: "The Kite Runner",
   2015: "Go Set a Watchman"
 }

# The U.S. title for the Harry Potter book published in 1997 is "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone".
# Update the title to its U.S. version.
best_selling_books [1997]  = "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"

# New sales data reveals that "The Hunt for Red October" was the actual best-seller for 1984
# and "The Da Vinci Code"  for 2003.
# Update these in a single operation.

best_selling_books.update ({
  1984: "The Hunt for Red October",
  2003: "The Da Vinci Code"
})

# The book published in 2015, "Go Set a Watchman," is no longer considered a best-seller.
# Use the del keyword to remove this entry from the dictionary.
del best_selling_books[2015]

# Print the updated dictionary of best selling books.
print(best_selling_books)

# Exercise 3. Manage Music Collection
# Create a Python program that manages a collection of music albums and their release years.
# You will use a dictionary where the keys are the release years and the values are the names of albums.
# The program should allow you to:

# - Print all the release years (keys) from the dictionary.
# - Print all the album names (values) from the dictionary.
# - Print both the release years and album names together.
# - Check if a particular year or album exists in the collection.


# Steps and pre-code
# Initialize a dictionary to store Bob Dylan's albums
dylan_albums = {
   1962: "Bob Dylan",
   1963: "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan",
   1975: "Blood on the Tracks",
   1997: "Time Out of Mind"
 }

# Use .keys() to loop through and print out all the release years
for year in dylan_albums.keys():
 print(year)

# Use .values() to loop through and print out all the album names
for album_names in dylan_albums.values():
 print(album_names)

# Use .items() to loop through and print out both the release year and album name

for year, album_names in dylan_albums.items():
    print(f'{year}:{album_names}')

# Use the 'in' keyword to check if a particular year or album is in the dictionary (pick any year and any album)
# Remember the keyword by default checks only the keys, not the values.
# If you want to check if a particular value (in this case, an album name),
# you need to specify that you're searching within the dictionary's values.

print("Blood on the Tracks" in dylan_albums.values())
print(1975 in dylan_albums)
#years = int(input('Enter a year: '))
#print(years in dylan_albums)

# Exercise 4. Remove duplicates
# Remove duplicates from the following dictionary:

# Steps:
# - Create a dict person
person = {
   'first': 'Jeff',
   'name': 'Jeff',
   'last': 'Smith',
   'last_name': 'Smith',
   'state': 'CA',
   'age': 55
}

# - Create an empty dictionary result = {}

result = {}

for label, info in person.items():  # - Create an empty dictionary result = {}
    if info not in result.values(): # - If itemâ€™s value not in result dict, add key value part into result.
        result[label] = info

print(result)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 5. Find the highest score
# Create a Python function named find_max_score that takes a dictionary of names and scores as an argument.
# The function should return the name and score of the person with the highest score in the form of a dictionary.

# Sample test_scores dictionary
test_scores = {
   'James': 83,
   'Julia': 91,
   'Ryan': 90,
   'Maria': 80,
   'David': 79,
   'Adam': 96,
   'Jennifer': 97,
   'Susan': 77
 }

#  Find the person with the highest test score and display both their name and score

# Steps:
# - Define a function called find_max_score that takes one argument, scores_dict, which is a dictionary of names
#   (as keys) and scores (as values).
def find_max_score(scores_dict):
    new_result = {}  # - Create an empty result variable
    max_score = 0    # - Assume the initial maximum score is 0

    # - Iterate over each key-value pair in the test_scores, using the .items() method
    for name, score in scores_dict.items():
        if score >= max_score: # - Check if the current score (v) is >= to the current maximum score
           max_score = score   # - If so, update the max score and assign the key-value pair to the result
           new_result = {name: score}

    return new_result   # - Return result and test the function

new_result = find_max_score(test_scores)
print(f'Output{new_result}')
