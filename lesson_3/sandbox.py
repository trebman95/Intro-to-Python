# Exercise 1: Temperature Classification
# You're developing a weather application. Write a program that takes
# a temperature in Fahrenheit as input. If the temperature is above
# 85Â°F, print "Hot day ahead!".
temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: "))

# <Your code here>
if temperature > 85:
    print('Hot day ahead!')
else:
    print('Where is my jacket?')
